# Print Odd and Even numbers in an Array 
This program prints out all the Odd and Even numbers found in an array.

## Below are the basic steps I used to complete this program: 

1. Import '**Scanner**' class from the '**java.util**' package.
2. First, Within the main method, create an instance of the '**Scanner**' class.
3. Then prompt the user to insert a value that'll be the length of the array, before storing it in a **int** variable.
4. Next, create and initialize a new array with value given by the user.
5. Using a **for** loop, loop through each index of the array and initialize it with a value specified by the user.
6. Using more **for** loops, Loop through each of the elements in the array, if a **int** is **Odd** or **Even** its printed in the terminal for you to see.
