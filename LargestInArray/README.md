# Pint the largest number in the array
This program prints out the largest number in a array using **'stream'** from the Arrays class.

## Below are the steps i took to inplement this program:

1. Import **'Scanner'** and **'Arrays'** class from their respective packages.
2. In the main method create an instance of the scanner class.
3. Create your array, initialize it to hold your desired value of indices.
4. Create for loop to looop through each index and initialize it with the value inputed by the user.
5. Using **'streams()'** method from **'Arrays'** we can easily get the largest integer in the array.
