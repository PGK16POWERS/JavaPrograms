# Find the average
This program allows you to find the average value from a given set of values.

## Steps of implementation: 

1. Inside the main methos, create and initialize an array with values of your choice.
2. Declare and initialize a variable (**sum**) to hold the sum of the values found in the array. Make sure to initialisze the variable with 0.
3. Using the '**forEach Loop**', Loop through each index in the array, while also adding and assigning each value to the '**variable**' you created earlier.
4. Next, declare a variable with a data type of '**double**', inside it you'll cast the value calculated from division of the '**sum**' variable and the length of the array.
5. Finally, output your findings.
