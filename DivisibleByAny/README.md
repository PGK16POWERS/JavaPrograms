# Divisible by any number
This program checks if a given number is divisble by a given divisor.

## These are the steps i took:
1. Import **'Scanner'** class.
2. In the **'main()'** method create an instance of the scanner class.
3. Create 2 **'int'** variables that will hold a **'Dividend'** and **'Divisor'** respectively.
4. Prompt the user to initialize each with a value .**(Using Scanner)**
5. Create an **'if-else'** conditional statement to check if the dividend is divisible by the divisor.
