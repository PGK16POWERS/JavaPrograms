#Sum Of Odd and Even Numbers in an Array
This program outputs the sum of odd and Even numbers found in an array.

##How to implement:
1. Import **'Scanner'** class.
2. inside the main method, create an instance of the scanner.
3. Prompt the user to initialize an/the array.
4. Store the integer.
5. Create an array, initialize it's length with the value given by the user.
6. Create a for loop, iterate through the array and prompt the user to initialize each index of the array with a value.
7. Create 2 variables **(sumOfEven)** and **(sumOfOdd)**, these variables will hold the sum of even and odd numbers respectively.
8. Create **'for-each'** loop to iterate through each index, add and assign each value respectively to the variable created prior.
9. Output findings
